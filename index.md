# LDAV 2017 - Big Data Analysis and Visualization

## October XX, 2017 â€“ Phoenix, Arizona

In many areas of science, simulations and experiments begin to generate many
petabytes of data, with some sciences facing exabytes of data near term.
Similarly, the collection of information about the Internet applications and
users for a variety of purposes is generating only more data. Our ability to
manage, mine, analyze, and visualize the data is fundamental to the knowledge
discovery process. That is, the value of data at extreme scale can be fully
realized only if we have an end-to-end solution, which demands a collective,
inter-disciplinary effort to develop.

This symposium, held in conjunction with IEEE VIS 2017, aims at bringing
together domain scientists, data analytics and visualization researchers, and
users, and fostering the needed exchange to develop the next-generation
data-intensive analysis and visualization technology. Attendees will be
introduced to the latest and greatest research innovations in large data
management, analysis, and visualization, learn how these innovations impact data
intensive computing and knowledge discovery, and also learn about the critical
issues in creating a complete solution through both invited and contributed
talks, and panel discussion. Paper submissions are solicited for a long paper
event that describes large data visualization techniques and systems, and a
short paper event for practitioners to describe and present their large data
visualization applications. Topic emphasis is on algorithms, languages, systems
and hardware that supports the analysis and visualization of large data.

There are a variety of ways to participate in LDAV 2016 - papers, posters, and
attending. We hope to see you there! Please register through the [IEEE VIS
website](ieeevis.org).
