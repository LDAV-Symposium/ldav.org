## Paper Presentation

All papers get 20 minutes for the talk and then 5 minutes for questions and switching presenters. We have a full schedule this year â€“ please stay on time.

There is an LDAV slide template available [here](assets/LDAV_2018_Template.pptx). 

To gain maximum size and benefit on the screen, we encourage speakers to utilize the 16x9 wide format Powerpoint templates.

Additional information regarding the facility equipment is available
