# Call for Papers

Contact: <papers@ldav.org>

Data scales are increasing throughout scientific, business, and research contexts. Large-scale scientific simulations, observation technologies, sensor networks, and experiments are generating enormous datasets, with some projects approaching the multiple exabyte range in the near term 

Gaining insight from massive data is critical for disciplines such as climate science, nuclear physics, security, materials design, transportation, urban planning, and so on. Business-critical decisions are made based on massive data in domains like social media, machine learning, software telemetry, and business intelligence. The tools and approaches needed to search, analyze, and visualize data at extreme scales can be fully realized only from end-to-end solutions, and with collective, interdisciplinary efforts.

The 8th IEEE Large Scale Data Analysis and Visualization (LDAV) symposium, to be held in conjunction with IEEE VIS 2018, is specifically targeting methodological innovation, algorithmic foundations, and possible end-to-end solutions. The LDAV symposium will bring together domain experts, data analysts, visualization researchers, and users to foster common ground for solving both near- and long-term problems.

## Scope
We are looking for both original research contributions and position papers on a broad-range of topics related to collection, analysis, manipulation, and visualization of large-scale data.  We are particularly interested in innovative approaches that combine information visualization, visual analytics, and scientific visualization.

We are interested in methods for data at scale, including: 
-	Distributed, parallel, and multi-threaded computation
-	Streaming methods
-	Innovative software solutions 
-	Advanced hardware and GPU-based approaches 
-	Hierarchical data storage, retrieval, processing, and rendering
-	Sampling, approximate query processing, and progressive computation
-	Collection, management, and curation of massive datasets
-	Scalable visualization and exploration methods
-	Ensemble data visualization and analysis
-	In-situ data analysis

We are also interested in understanding state of the art techniques, including:
-	Best practices for large data visualization
-	End-to-end system solutions in a large data context
-	Industry solutions for big data analysis and visualization

We are interested in research on the context of visualization, including:
-	Collaboration or/and co-design of large data analysis with domain  experts
-	Topics in cognitive issues specific to manipulating and understanding large data
-	Application case studies
-	New challenges in visualizing experimental, observational, or simulation data 

### Full Papers
Full papers should have a maximum length of  9 pages with up to two (2) additional pages allowed for only references (maximum total of 11 pages). Full papers may make contributions in techniques, systems, applications, evaluations, or theory. The contributions of full papers are reviewed based on their novelty, contribution, replicability, and evaluation.

### Short Papers
Short papers should have a length of 4-5 pages in total. Short papers are a venue to report smaller contributions than full papers. Position papers and showcases of interesting application of visualization are good topics for short papers. Technique, system, application, evaluation, or theory papers that have a smaller contribution than a full paper can also be submitted as a short paper.

## Submission

**Submission Instructions**:
LDAV is accepting both full papers and short papers. The manuscripts should be formatted according to guidelines from IEEE VGTC. Submission of an abstract is required prior to submission of a paper or short paper.

**Please check back for further submission instructions in the near future.**
<!-- **Submission site note**: Go to the submission site (https://precisionconference.com/~vgtc), log in, go to 'new submissions', and select 'LDAV 2018 Papers'. -->


## Proceedings
The proceedings of the symposium will be published together with the VIS proceedings and via the IEEE Xplore Digital Library.

## Best Paper
The LDAV Program Committee will present a Best Paper award to the authors whose submission is deemed the strongest according to the reviewing criteria. This award will be announced in conjunction with VIS 2018.
